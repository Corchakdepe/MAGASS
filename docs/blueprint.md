# **App Name**: BikeSim Studio

## Core Features:

- File Upload: Upload CSV, JSON, and XML files for simulation input.
- Simulation Parameter Input: Input simulation parameters via form controls (checkbox, select, sliders).
- Run Simulation: Trigger the simulation with uploaded files and selected parameters, which are all passed to the backend simulation tool.
- Zone Summary Display: Display zone summary numbers after the simulation completes.
- Interactive Visualization: Display simulation results using map, heat map, or charts with tabbed navigation.
- Data Export: Export the simulation results as a CSV file.
- Simulation Configuration Reasoning: Uses generative AI to make intelligent suggestions about simulation configurations and parameters based on user data and previous simulations; recommends scenarios and data inputs for consideration with simulation tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky Blue (#74b9ff) to evoke feelings of openness, possibility and trustworthiness, subtly suggestive of travel and urban landscapes.
- Background color: Light Gray (#f5f6fa), providing a clean, neutral backdrop that emphasizes content.
- Accent color: Soft Green (#a2d9ce), for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use flat, modern icons related to data and analysis. 
- Sidebar on the left for parameters, main content area on the right for visualizations.
- Subtle transitions and animations for tab changes and data updates.
